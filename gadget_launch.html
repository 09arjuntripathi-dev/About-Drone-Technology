    <h2>What is a Drone?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A drone, also called an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is a broad term that refers to an aircraft that operates autonomously or by remote control, with no pilot on board. Drones are usually small-or-medium-sized, and these ‘flying robots’ can carry out a wide range of tasks, from stealth military operations to package delivery to aerial photography.

    <h2>UAV Meaning</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Another name for drones is unmanned aerial vehicle, which is an aircraft that doesn’t require a pilot to be physically onboard. UAVs are often separated into two categories — civilian and military. While civilian UAVs are used for package deliveries and recreation, military drones are used for reconnaissance missions and aerial combat.

    <h3>How Drones work</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In order to fly, drones rely on a combination of hardware and software components. They are often equipped with rotors, propellers or fixed wings, sensors and cameras, navigation systems (GPS) and gyroscopes for stability.

Additionally, some of the most critical components of drone technology are its ground control station (GCS), payload and data links. Ground control stations are the hardware and software setups that allow drone operators to communicate with a drone from the ground. The GCS can be user controlled or operated via satellites. Drones are often capable of carrying payloads, which can range from life-saving medication to Amazon packages. Data links act as the transmission center that allow the drone to communicate with the ground operator while in flight.
